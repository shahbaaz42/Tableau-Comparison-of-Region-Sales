## 📝 Learning Experience
This project enhanced my Tableau skills by teaching me how to:  
- Use **parameters and calculated fields** for dynamic filtering.  
- Build **hierarchies** for geographic drill-down.  
- Align multiple visualizations (tables, line graphs, bar charts, and maps) in a professional dashboard layout.  
- Organize data into **folders** for efficiency.  

Working through challenges like aligning sub-categories across tables and graphs gave me strong problem-solving experience, and I am now more confident in building **professional-grade dashboards** for real-world analysis.
